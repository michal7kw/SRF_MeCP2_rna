# Azenta Project 90-1115332406

this is a RNA-seq on human Neurons and human NPCs in which we overexpress Mecp2.

Sample are: 
hPG1
hPG2
hPG3
hPM1
hPM2
hPM3
hNG1
hNG2
hNG3
hNM1
hNM2
hNM3

the legend is:

h= human
P= NPCs
N= Neurons
G= GFP (control)
M= Mecp2

The comparison is between PM group against PG, and NM group against NG.
